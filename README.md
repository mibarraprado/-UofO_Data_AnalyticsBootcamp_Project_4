# Titanic
<h1>Spaceship Titanic</h1>

<p>Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four light years away and things aren't looking good.</p>

<p>The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.</p>

<p>While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!</p>

<p>To help rescue crews retrieve the lost passengers, we are to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.</p>

<p><strong>Help save them and change history!</strong></p>

<h2>Passenger Data Available:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.</li>
  <li>HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.</li>
  <li>CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.</li>
  <li>Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.</li>
  <li>Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.</li>
  <li>Age - The age of the passenger.</li>
  <li>VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.</li>
  <li>RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.</li>
  <li>Name - The first and last names of the passenger.</li>
  <li>Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension.</li>
</ul>
